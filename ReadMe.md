# Pokémon Python Code Testing

Welcome to the Pokémon Python Code Testing repository! This project utilizes Python along with the PokéAPI to provide insights into Pokémon evolution chains and methods.

## Overview

This repository houses a Python script (`pokemon.py`) designed to interact with the PokéAPI. It fetches evolution data for any Pokémon you input, offering detailed information about its evolution chain and the methods required for its evolution.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the Python script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Additionally, make sure you have the `requests` library installed. You can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```
